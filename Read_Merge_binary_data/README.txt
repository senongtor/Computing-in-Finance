In this homework, I used a mapper for each date directory to map tickers to unique id number. Then I will read over all the .rt files for each date and convert them into <some numbers>_1.dat using the reformatgzip class. After that, I will do a mergeiterative which just scan over the .dat file list for each date and merge them 2 or 3 at a time using the Merger class and generate newer version of the old .dat files The number stays the same but we only change the version number. I wrote a driver class Mergeall to implement all the functionality. For some reason, there is an error when running but I can still get the desired result.
